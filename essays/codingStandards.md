<h1>First hearing the news</h1>
  I first heard we were going to transition to online schooling while I was in my Linear Algebra class.  It blew my mind!  I had thought this virus was just another virus that flooded the news, such as swine flu. I didn't believe the people in class talking about it and I had to ask over and over if they were being serious or just messing with me.  I was kind of thrilled because I like being home at my own desk and having my work station while doing homework. It's harder for me to get things done at school.  Once I beleived everyone I started wondering what was to come.  Would we all get the grades we were currently getting? How would the school make it fair?  Would we get some money back? I was stoked that exams would be at home because it would hopefully make it easier having the internet.
  
<h2>What has happened so far</h2>
  All of our classes have trinsitioned to online.  Luckily I'm a computer science student because a lot of the homework I was turning in was already online.  For example, in software engineering, we were building websites before the shutdown and we were turning them in on Laulima, UH's online portal.  Now we are doing the same thing, so that class hasn't changed much.  However, once a week we were given a type of pop quiz called a WOD which was worth a lot of points, 100 points, which is 10x a normal assignment.  Now those WODs are worth only 10 points and we are not timed on them.  This is very nice!
  
  My Hawaiian studies class has moved online which is terrible.  Instead of getting a lecture from the teacher, now we have to read.  I very much dislike reading textbooks that aren't about computer science.  I have a very hard time focusing.  I think that is what most students are complaining about, is that it's hard to focus at home because there are so many distractions.  This Hawaiian studies class is definitely a good example of that for me.
  
 <h2>What I want to happen</h2>
 There are two things I would like to see UH implement that would make this semester fair
 <ul>
  <li>We all get our money back</li>
  <li>We get the option to drop our classes without it being on our record.</li>
  </ul>
