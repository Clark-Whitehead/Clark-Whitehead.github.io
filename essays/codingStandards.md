## What is the point of coding standards?
  Coding standards are annoying to use when you start learning them.  This is because you probably haven't worked in an environment with many other programmers working together on a single project.  If you had, you would realize that without standards we all would have very different coding styles.  There are two main reasons for implementing coding standards into a company.  First, the code could be very hard to read if it's spaced way to far apart or crammed way to close together.  There are so many different ways that code style can be different from one programmer to the next, including curly braces, spaces, indentation, comments, lack of comments and more.
