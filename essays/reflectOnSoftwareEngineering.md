<h1 style="color: red">Open Source Software Development</h1>
Working with a team on a single project is difficult, but GitHub makes the process very smooth.  Github is a data storage website for software development.  It allows multiple users to join single projects, create tasks for that project, assign roles to each task, and store all the files of the project.  There is a master copy of the project and there are branches that you can create there are copies of the project.  These branches can be created from the master, or even from another branch.  The purpose of these branches is to do test edits and work on a specific piece of the project without risking the main project.  One a branch is working properly, it can be merged into the master branch.  After all the branches are working properly and merged into the master branch, the resulting master is a finished working app.

Working with a team makes creating an app much faster, but the downside of working with multiple people is that you don't learn as much.  Each team member takes on only a portion of the tasks required.  For example, one person might work on user accounts and logins, another member may work on databases, another on aesthetic design, and another on functionality.  However, this means three members might be unsure of how to integrate user accessibility into their portions of the project.  I actually encountered this exact issue with my team.  Whenever the three of us worked on a task that related to user profiles, we would need to ask for assistance from the team member who specifically knew user accounts best.  Another example is after any of us built a page, we would have to request our team member who handled aesthetics to redesign a page after the functionality had been built.  This works well when each team member is strong in their specific field as we were, but I don't feel like I could build a working app on my own right now after this project.

<h3 style="color: green">User Interface Frameworks</h3>
Meteor is a great framework for building apps.  It utilizes Semantic UI and React.  Semantic UI is a great web design framework that has a very large library of prebuilt designs for components such as headers, footers, menus, and much more.  It has prebuilt Icons, buttons, star ratings, loading bars, and much much more.  It makes building a website very convenient.  React is great because it allows the application to change data without reloading the page.  It also makes the app much faster, scalable, and simple.  Meteor allows for the use of a single language which is Javascript.  Javascript is used for front-end, back-end, and database.  Meteor also allows for real-time apps.  This is how such functions as messenger work, with live updated local databases.  Lastly, you can easily convert a meteor web abb into a mobile app using Cordova.

<h3 style="color: blue">Ethics in Software Engineering</h3>
The ethics regarding self driving cars really caught my attention.  Should the vehicle prioritize the drivers safety over pedestrians?  How about the ethics regarding sentient AI?  What if humans manage to build sentient programs that are as conscious as we are, should they have human rights?  Imagine the google of the future manages to copy your brain into code.  You wake up in a simulation and you feel exactly like yourself, but you are informed by a voice that you are just computer code, and that if they wanted to they could just delete you.  Should that be legal?  Should someone be able to delete sentient code?  What is the difference between sentient code and the human brain when it comes to consciousness.  Human DNA is just code, and our brains function because electronic signals are transferred over our neurons.  I believe it's possible that there will be no or almost very little difference between human and sentient AI consciousness.  As a data science student I believe it's parts of my job to think about the ethics regarding the programming, deletion, and care of sentient AI.  It's possible we will be like gods to the future beings in our computers, but we must not let evil people in the real world create hell for some sentient AI.  Just as PETA protects animals' lives without a voice, coders must have rules in place to protect AI.
