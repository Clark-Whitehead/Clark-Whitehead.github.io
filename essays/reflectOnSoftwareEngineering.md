<h1 style="color: orange">Open Source Software Development</h1>
Working with a team on a single project is difficult, but GitHub makes the process very smooth.  Github is a data storage website for software development.  It allows multiple users to join single projects, create tasks for that project, assign roles to each task, and store all the files of the project.  There is a master copy of the project and there are branches that you can create there are copies of the project.  These branches can be created from the master, or even from another branch.  The purpose of these branches is to do test edits and work on a specific piece of the project without risking the main project.
