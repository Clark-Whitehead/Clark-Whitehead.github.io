<h1 style="color: red">Open Source Software Development</h1>
Working with a team on a single project is difficult, but GitHub makes the process very smooth.  Github is a data storage website for software development.  It allows multiple users to join single projects, create tasks for that project, assign roles to each task, and store all the files of the project.  There is a master copy of the project and there are branches that you can create there are copies of the project.  These branches can be created from the master, or even from another branch.  The purpose of these branches is to do test edits and work on a specific piece of the project without risking the main project.  One a branch is working properly, it can be merged into the master branch.  After all the branches are working properly and merged into the master branch, the resulting master is a finished working app.

Working with a team makes creating an app much faster, but the downside of working with multiple people is that you don't learn as much.  Each team member takes on only a portion of the tasks required.  For example, one person might work on user accounts and logins, another member may work on databases, another on asthetic design, and another on functionality.  However, this means three members might be unsure of how to integrate user accesibility into their portions of the project.  I actually encountered this exact issue with my team.  Whenever the three of us worked on a task that related to user profiles, we would need to ask for assistance from the team member who specifically knew user ccounts best.  Another example is after any of us built a page, we would have to request our team member who handled asthetics to redesign a page after the functionality had been built.  This works well when each team member is strong in their specific field as we were, but I don't feel like I could build a working app on my own right now after this project.

Meteor is a great framework for building apps.  It utilizes Semantic UI and React.  Semantic UI is great web design framework that has very large library of prebuild designs for components such as headers, footers, menus, and much more.  It has prebuild Icons, buttons, star ratings, loading bars, and much much more.  It makes building a website very convenient.  React is great because it allows the application to change data without reloading the page.  It also makes the app much faster, scalable, and simple.  Meteor allows for the use of a single language which is Javascript.  Javascript is used for front-end, back-end, and database.  Meteor also allows for real-time apps.  This is how such functions as messenger work, with live updated local databases.  Lastly, you can easily convert a meteor web abb into a mobile app using Cordova.
