I've been creating websites for the last 10 years for 3 different businesses I started.

The companies didn't revolve around the websites, they were physical product based businesses. But without a customized website that fit my idea of what my customers wanted I don't believe we would have reached over $3000 per day in online sales.

The four main building blocks I relied on were Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS.  None were more important than the other, because without any one of them, I wouldn't have had all the functionality I needed.

I've been at this for more than 10 years and I can tell you, Javascript is practically the same as when I started and we will continue needing it for a long time to come.

## When it comes to interaction

Without Javascript we wouldn't have slideshows. Without slideshows our customers would have had to scroll down a long page to view pictures of our products.  Javascript not only allows slideshows, but interaction.  When a viewer wants to scroll faster than the alloted time of the slideshow he can click a button which moves the slides forward.  He can also click on the image itself and view a larger version of it.

Have you ever updated your bio on a website.  Each field is already filled with your previously entered information.  The way I made this possible was by pulling the data with php and then assigning it to a javascript variable array and using that array to populate the fields.  We can also use Javascript variables to collect user input into arrays and then send that to PHP for storage.

You wouldn't have drop down menues without Javascript.  Javascript allows realtime manipulation of the css on websites which is how you can click on a menu button and then see a box with settings, profile, etc.

## Javascript in Machine Learning

Have you heard of Artificial Intelligence?  If you haven't you're life is lacking some serious excitement.  Self driving cars are most exciting in this arena because we want to be as lazy as possible, but now websites and apps can utilize machine learning as well with the help of Javascript.  

Machine learning requires graphics cards do handle matrix math.  Well luckily there is something called WebGL, which is something Javascript can access in order to create the perfect user experience based on each persons preferences that humans wouldn't be able to see or communicate, such as what type of videos you really love watching on youtube, or what size font holds your attention longest.

Tensorflow is already creating MS libraries for JS called deeplearn.js.

## In regards to ES6

I'm loving what I'm seeing so far in regards to the updates on the Javascript language.  It's been a long time since I brushed up on my knowledge of common practices in regards to the language, because I'm used to just using what I learned long ago, but this code I agree is much cleaner and practical.

Being able to use arrow functions like this is amazing.

```
const myFunc = () => "value";
```

It is a slight challenge to not get annoyed when you finally learn a new technique just when a better newer version is released.  But you have to realize it's better to be constantly learning than be the person who is perfectly learned for a world that doesn't exist anymore.

## WODS

I find the WODS very annoying at the moment because the addition of a time parameter in the function of your mind finding a solution to a programming problem actually slows your brains runtime, but hopefully this is just a temporary outcome.  I am curious if training in this way will actually increase productivity.  Like I said, I've been programming for more than 10 years and I believe I come up with my best solutions when I'm completely stress free and can completely focus on the solution.  Perhaps it will take me more time to come up with a working algorithm, but almost always, that algorithms runtime will be drastically faster than an algorithm that I created quickly just so it can run regardless of runtime.

## So yes!

Javascript is very much so worth learning.

It is without a doubt a necessary skill to have if you want to create web applications that people will enjoy.  You can always create a website with a premade template but I believe it's very rare for that template to fit a business perfectly.  Being able to customize your own website will make your users love your site, and you can't do that properly without Javascript.
