<h2 style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 2px 2px red">Design patterns can solve many issues facing software teams</h2>
  Now imagine the boss asks a team member to frame a door so the boss can install it.  The team member frames the door, and the next day the boss goes to install the door.  The boss tries to install a door that has two door knobs and three hinges, however, the door frame was only <i>designed</i> for one door knob and two hinges.  This lack of agreement on design patterns would stall the entire project and would require backtracking.  The boss and all team members would need an agreed upon structure for each module and it's dependencies.  We see this in software engineering and we have a name for this, <i>Design Patterns</i>.  The three most important design patterns in my opinion are dependencies between modules, naming, and single responsibility.

<h2 style="color: green">Dependencies Between Modules</h2>
The construction of a home can be dvidided into many modules. One such module could be pouring the cement foundation. Another module could be framing the house.  Another module could be designing the blue prints of the home.  Could you frame the house without the cement foundatoin?  Could you frame it without the blue prints?  You can't because these modules are dependent on eachother.  An ownership graph is a design pattern that is useful to help all team members understand how an app functions so they don't alter and break depedencies between modules.  

<h2 style="color: green">Naming</h2>
How long would it take a team of construction workers to build a house if each team member had a different name for a 2x4 board?  How about if each team member had a different name for nails, hammers, saws, etc.  The boss could ask an employee for a nail gun and instead be given a saw.  It would be as if each team member spoke a different language.  What you need is everyone to speak the same language. This relates to variables in coding. There must be a design pattern to naming variables so they are understood by the other team members.
