How long would it take a team of construction workers to build a house if each team member had a different name for a 2x4 board?  How about if each team member had a different name for nails, hammers, saws, etc.  The boss could ask an employee for a nail gun and instead be given a saw.  It would be as if each team member spoke a different language.  What you need is everyone to speak the same language.  Ok, let's say they all speak english and all the supplies and tools have agreed upon names.  Now imagine the boss asks a team member to frame a door so the boss can install it.  The team member frames the door, and the next day the boss goes to install the door.  The door the boss tries to install has two door knobs and three hinges, however, the door frame was only <i>designed</i> for one door knob and two hinges.  This lack of agreement on design patterns would stall the entire project and would require backtracking.  We see this in software engineering and we have a name for this, <i>Design Patterns</i>.  The three most important design patterns in my opinion are dependencies between modules, one way data flow, and single responsibility.
