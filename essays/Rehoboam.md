<h2 style="color: orange; text-shadow: 2px 2px red">My initial response to coding ethics</h2> 
I'd never actually heard of coding ethics before reading the ethics foundation series.  If someone had asked what my thoughts are on the topic two days ago, I would have gone on a rant about bitcoin, identity theft, webcam hacking, computer viruses, and possibly vulgar websites such as adult content sites. However, my eyes are now open and I've narrowed down all the coding ethics standards into the three that I feel are most important; <strong>"Avoid harm", "Honor confidentiality", and "Contribute to society"</strong>.

<h2 style="color: green">Avoid harm</h2>
I'll focus the rest of this reading on self driving cars, and apply these three coding ethics to this problem. Because self driving cars are for the time being, machines of death.  Coding ethics tell us to avoid harm.  Yes this could mean don't hack and steal people's information, but this also means what it sounds like, we need to avoid physically harming anyone.  But the truth is, this isn't always possible.  Take for example, a hypothetical senario where a tesla is driving down a road at 45mph.  Imagine a boy the age of six years old is chasing a basketball into the street and runs in front of the tesla.  Now imagine that the only avoidance of hitting the child is to abruptly turn the wheel, causing the tesla to run into a large parked truck, and possibly killing the passenger of the tesla.  The programmers of the tesla have to options to apply ethics to in this case.  Should they kill the boy or the passenger?  The passenger is obviously older than the boy by many years and most people would agree that the boy should be saved in exchange for the adults life, I agree with this.  But who is right here?  Who should have the final say on this decision, should it be government, or perhaps a large poll of the population of a country?  Or is it the choice of the coders?  A great observation made by <i>Emerging Technology from the arXiv</i>, is that telling people that the car they are purchasing will kill them in order to save the lives of two others, would very likely discourage them from purchasing the car.  This would ultimately cause more deaths because human drivers kill far more people than telsa do. I think we shouldn't inform the public of the cars ability to kill them rather than kill a child or a group of people.  This might seems unethical, but it will actually save more lives in the long run, so in fact, telling them is actually the unethical desicion.  Or is it?
