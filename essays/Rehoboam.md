<h2 style="color: orange; text-shadow: 2px 2px red">My initial response to coding ethics</h2> 
I'd never actually heard of coding ethics before reading the ethics foundation series.  If someone had asked what my thoughts are on the topic two days ago, I would have gone on a rant about bitcoin, identity theft, webcam hacking, computer viruses, and possibly vulgar websites such as adult content sites. However, my eyes are now open and I've narrowed down all the coding ethics standards into the three that I feel are most important; <strong>"Avoid harm", "Honor confidentiality", and "Contribute to society"</strong>.
