Beyond the basics

I took at web design class when I was 18 years old and I had just started college.  I just wanted to learn how to build a store without having to pay anyone so I could sell fishing products on there and make a living.  But I fell in love with being able to manipulate a world so easily.  I was amazed at what I had learned and what I could build.  It rivaled the websites I knew of that were so great.  My first class the teacher tried to fail me because she said I had copied all my code.  She said that nobody could learn all that in the amount of time I was in her class.  I fought it and proved that I coded everything from scratch such as drop down menus, slide shows and purchase options.
