## Overview

<strong>Problem:</strong> Most students are generally shy and have a hard time introducing themselves to new people unless it's someone they sit next to in class. It's especially hard right now to meet new people, due to Covid-19.
  
<strong>Solution:</strong> My final project will be a mobile application that connects students through messaging.  The app will pair two users together each day with someone they haven't talked to yet.  Each morning they will get a message that says, "Hi (their name here), you have been paired with (their pairs name here) today. Say hi!" 

## Approach
Meteor is perfect for a messaging app given it's live updated local databases.  

  ### Mock up pages:
  <ul>
  <li>Landing Page with login and signup</li>
  <li>MyProfile (only the account owner can see)</li>
  <li>Profile (viewed by others)</li>
  <li>Terms of service</li>
  </ul>

## Use case ideas
<ul>
  <li>New user visits website, starts on landing page, creates an account, brought to profile page, informed a new match will be provided at 8am everyday.</li>
  <li>MyProfile (only the account owner can see)</li>
  <li>Profile (viewed by others)</li>
  <li>Terms of service</li>
</ul>

## Beyond the basics
